Hello dear developer, 

This package <scRabble> helps it users reassemble strings of characters into actual words. 

Uses: when playing Scrabble and you feel the need to cheat, when playing Scrabble and you are too 
lazy to count points, when you're playing Scrabble and want to know if a word exists. 

You can also use this package to create lists of words from a string of characters... idk, get creative. 

Function: 

- get_words() takes in a string of letters, optional length of words, and optional wildcard and returns a list of words made up from the string of letters, and if chosen all words are a certain length and/or contain a wildcard letter. 

- points() takes in a word, location for double/triple points on letter, and if double/triple word points are applicable; and returns the total score. 

- num_words() if you don't want to cheat but want to know if your random string of letters can actually make a word, this function will return the amount of words that can be written with the string of letters provided. It also takes the length of words and wildcard as an option. 

- is_word() let's you know if a word exists.
